                	<p class="lead text-muted">Hi, my name is Kevin Tang. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago,
												where I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration.
												Most of my education consisted of OOP in Java and C#, relational databases using SQL, 
												agile development methodologies, algorithms, and some C/C++. </p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">On my journey in exploring the many facets of the tech industry, I kicked off my career working as a Software 
												Development Engineer in Test Consultant, picking up a wide variety of tools, methodologies, and experiences.</p>
					<p class="lead text-muted">As an SDET, I've had the opportunity to play an active role in the software development life-cycle at the a client company,
												including spearheading the test planning, documentation, and execution processes across 5 different projects, end to end.
												I was able to demonstrate my C# skills through UI automation tests utilizing Selenium WebDriver and significantly cut down
												the time spent in manual testing phases by creating tools for manual testers that made mock data generation, test monitoring,
												and test report generation. It is throughout my experience in software testing that I realized that my passion lies in developing 
												well written code and creating solutions to make complex problems simple. I am now pursuing a new opportunity as a Software Engineer.</p>

                <p class="lead text-muted"> 
				<a target="_blank" href="http://uic.kappapibeta.org/">Kappa Pi Beta Fraternity, Inc. -</a><br />
											   Joining this brotherhood has taught me more about myself than I thought attending college ever would have. During my activehood in the 
												organization, I have learned the true meaning of brotherhood, leadership, integrity, and expressing the qualities of which	
												a disciplined gentleman should portray. Through working hard as a team, being involved on campus, and hundreds of service hours, 
												Kappa Pi Beta is one of the biggest factors in what helped shape me into who I am today.</p>

                <h2 class="section-header">Passion</h2>
                <p class="lead text-muted">Simply put, video games have been undoubtedly one of the biggest factors in my personal development. From sitting on my living room floor playing 
											party games with my family, to competing in multiple tournaments and leading large communities, my passion for gaming has made me who I am today. 
											It was the absolute deciding factor for me to pursue a Computer Science degree, and what connected me to some of my closest friends.
											Every aspect of video games, including the gameplay, the art, the competition, the people, and even the losses are something that I have grown to 
											constantly appreciate.</p>
				<p class="lead text-muted">Nowadays, you'll probably catch me putting free time into World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Counter-Strike, Hearthstone, or 
											maybe battling it out in Street Fighter or Marvel vs Capcom at a local gaming lounge. Some personal achievements of mine
											include placing first in more than 20 local and regional tournaments for multiple fighting games, and being a founding member 
											and leader of a server rank 1 raiding guild in WoW.</p>

					Web development was something that I had overlooked throughout my college career, as most of my focus was on
					Java and C# development. With plenty of free time on my hands, I'm looking to strengthen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills
					further, as well as explore some popular JS libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery and AngularJS.</p>
